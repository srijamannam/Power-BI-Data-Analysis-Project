# Power-BI-Data-Analysis-Project
**Project Overview:**
    
    Comprehensive exploration of Power BI functionalities.
    Focus on connecting and transforming data from various sources (CSV, folders, APIs, SQL Server, Python scripts).
    Data Transformation:

    Utilized Power Query Editor for transformation tasks.
    Applied tools for text, number, date manipulation, grouping, pivoting, and merging queries.
    
**Data Modeling:**
    
    Process included normalization and creating relationships.
    Established star and snowflake schemas using hierarchies.
    
**DAX Usage:**

    Extensive use of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for data analysis.
    Covered various DAX functions: conditional, logical, date and time, text, math, stats, COUNT, CALCULATE, ALL, FILTER, iterator, RELATED, and time intelligence functions.
    
**Data Visualization:**

    Leveraged Power BI features for visualization, including objects, charts, conditional formatting, tooltips, filtering, drill-through filters, and interactive visualizations.
    Explored defining hierarchies, implementing query folding, and managing roles and row-level security.
    
**Report Details:**

    Connected multiple data and fact tables.
    Demonstrated the process of establishing relationships and filtering data flow.
    Emphasized database normalization and relationships between data/fact tables and lookup/dimension tables.
    Showcased creation of calculated columns and measures using DAX.
