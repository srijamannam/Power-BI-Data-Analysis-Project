# Power-BI-Data-Analysis-Project

Conducted data integration from diverse sources (CSV, API, SQL, Python) and implemented data modeling 
techniques, including normalization, relationships (fact and dimension tables), and star and snowflake schemas

Utilized Power Query Editor for data transformation; Analyzed data with DAX queries, creating calculated 
columns and explicit measures, and visualized the data in Power BI to show critical insights

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was extensively used for data analysis, involving the calculation of columns and explicit measures. The project covered a range of DAX functions, including conditional, logical, date and time, text, math, stats, COUNT, CALCULATE, ALL, FILTER, iterator, RELATED, and time intelligence functions.
